\usage{
gallicagram(
  keyword,
  corpus = "lemonde",
  from = "earliest",
  to = "latest",
  resolution = "monthly",
  n_of = "grams"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{keyword}{A character string. Keyword to search.
The largest number of words the keyword can contain can be found
in the \code{resolution} column of the \code{list_corpora} dataset.}

\item{corpus}{A character string. The corpus to search. The list of
available corpora can be found in the \code{list_corpora} dataset.}

\item{from}{An integer or "earliest". The starting year.
If set to "earliest", use the earliest date at which the data is reliable
for this corpus, as described in \code{list_corpora}.}

\item{to}{An integer or "latest". The end year.
If set to "latest", use the latest date at which the data is reliable
for this corpus, as described in \code{list_corpora}.}

\item{resolution}{A character string. Can only be "daily", "monthly" or
"yearly".
The finest available resolution for the corpus selected can be found
in the \code{resolution} column of the \code{list_corpora} dataset.}
}
\value{
A tibble. With the \code{keyword},
the number of occurrences (\code{n_occur}) or co-occurrences

given observation (\code{n_grams} or \code{n_ngrams}),
the proportion of occurrences or co-occurrences of the keyword(s) over the
period of a given observation (\code{prop_occcur} or \code{prop_coocccur}),
the date at the beginning of the period of a given observation (\code{date}),
the \code{corpus}, the \code{resolution},
the \code{year} and
potentially the \code{month} and \code{day} of the observation.
