\title{Close co-occurrences of two keywords in a Gallicagram copus}
\usage{
gallicagram_cooccur(
  keyword_1,
  keyword_2,
  corpus = "lemonde",
  from = "earliest",
  to = "latest",
  resolution = "monthly",
  count_period = TRUE,
  n_of = "grams"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{keyword_1}{A character string. One of the two keywords to search.}

\item{keyword_2}{A character string. The other keyword to search.}

\item{corpus}{A character string. The corpus to search. The list of
available corpora can be found in the \code{list_corpora} dataset.}

\item{from}{An integer or "earliest". The starting year.
If set to "earliest", use the earliest date at which the data is reliable
for this corpus, as described in \code{list_corpora}.}

\item{to}{An integer or "latest". The end year.
If set to "latest", use the latest date at which the data is reliable
for this corpus, as described in \code{list_corpora}.}

\item{resolution}{A character string.
For press and lemonde can be either "yearly" or "monthly".
For books can only be "yearly".}

\item{count_period}{If FALSE, counts the co-occurrences of each phrase
containing both keywords.
If TRUE, returns the number of times both keywords co-occur
in each resolution period.}

\item{n_of}{A character string. The type of object to compute number of
occurrences for. If set to "grams", will compute the number of "grams" that
correspond to the keyword for the given period. If set to "article" (only
available for lemonde), will compute the number of articles that contain the
keyword for the given period.}
}
\value{
A tibble. With the \code{keyword},
the number of occurrences (\code{n_occur}) or co-occurrences
(\code{n_cooccur}), the total number of ngrams over the period of a
given observation (\code{n_grams} or \code{n_ngrams}),
the proportion of occurrences or co-occurrences of the keyword(s) over the
period of a given observation (\code{prop_occcur} or \code{prop_coocccur}),
the date at the beginning of the period of a given observation (\code{date}),
the \code{corpus}, the \code{resolution},
the \code{year} and
potentially the \code{month} and \code{day} of the observation.
}
\description{
Retrieves the proportion of close co-occurrences of two keywords in one of
the corpora by year, month or day.
}
\details{
Close co-occurrences correspond to the number of 3-grams
(4-grams in the Le Monde corpus) that contain the two keywords.

This function corresponds to the \code{Contain} route of the API.
